Whatever method is chosen to download the code, we assume that you have now
on your working directory a new directory, named \verb=RegCM-4.4.x=.
That directory will be for the rest of this guide referred as 
\verb=$REGCM_ROOT= .

All the operations to build the model binaries will be performed in this
directory.

\section{Software requirements}

In order to configure and install the RegCM code, the following software are
needed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item GNU Make program
\item Fortran 2003 compiler
\item One in:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item C compiler for the serial option (\verb=enable-mpi-serial= at
      configure)
    \item MPI2 Message Passing Library compiled with the above fortran compiler
     for parallel runs using multiple core single machines or cluster of
     machines (default).  Source code for the implementation code was tested
     with can be obtained at: \\
     {\bf http://www.open-mpi.org}
  \end{enumerate}
\item netCDF (\cite{Rew_90}) Format I/O library compiled with the above
  Fortran compiler.  Source code can be found from \\
  {\bf ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf} \\
\end{enumerate}

Optional requirements strongly suggested are :

\begin{enumerate}
\item HDF5 Format I/O Library compiled with the above fortran compiler to
enable netCDF V4 features. Source code can be obtained at: \\
{\bf http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src} \\
Note that some of the input datasets available from ICTP from 2012 DO require
this option, as we distribute data in the netCDF V4 format.
Note that current netCDF version 4.3.1.1/4.2 is dependent on HDF5 1.8.12.
\item NCO netCDF Operators for manging netCDF file. Most Linux distribution
have this already packed, and you should refer to your System Administrator or
OS Software Installation manual to obtain it. Source code is at: \\
{\bf http://nco.sourceforge.net/src}
\item CDO Climatic data Operators for managing netCDF file. Most Linux
distribution have this already packed, and you should refer to your System
Administrator or OS Software Installation manual to obtain it.
Source code is at: \\
{\bf https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/files}
\item A Scientific Plotting and Data Analysis Software such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item IGES GrADS 2.0 Graphical Analysis and Display System. Convenient helpers
are packed in RegCM to use GrADS with RegCM netCDF output files.
Binaries and source code can be obtained from \\
{\bf http://www.iges.org/grads/downloads.html}
\item NCL, NCAR CISL Command Language. The NCL can read netCDF output files, and
sample scripts can be found in the {\em Tools/Scripts/NCL} directory.
Binaries and source code can be obtained from \\
{\bf http://www.ncl.ucar.edu}
\end{itemize}
\item A quick viewer for netCDF files like NcView: \\
{\bf http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview\_home\_page.html}
\end{enumerate}

A script is shipped in the RegCM codebase in the Tools directory to help
user compile and install required packages, and its usage is detailed in
chapter $\ref{Appendice}$.

\section{Configuring build}

The RegCM Version 4.4 is configured by a configure script, which will select
the known working configuration for the supported architectures.

Currently tested and supported configurations (OS/Compiler) are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Linux with GNU gfortran compiler version $\ge 4.6$
\item Linux with Intel\texttrademark ifort compiler version $\ge 12.0$
\item Linux with Portland\texttrademark pgf95 compiler version $\ge 11.0$
\item Mac OsX\texttrademark with gfortran compiler $\ge 4.6$ from MacPorts
\item IBM AIX\texttrademark with xlf2003 compiler
\end{enumerate}

The 4.4 version of the RegCM model relies on the standard GNU autotools to
configure and build the model code.

The first step is to change working directory to \verb=$REGCM_ROOT= and run the
\verb=configure= script giving as arguments the chosen compilers:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> cd $REGCM_ROOT
$> ./configure CC=icc FC=ifort
\end{Verbatim}

To know the list of arguments that can be given to the configure script, the
script can be launched with the \verb=--help= command line argument.

\begin{Verbatim}
$> ./configure --help
\end{Verbatim}

The useful arguments to successfully build the model are:

\begin{Verbatim}
  --with-netcdf           Path to NetCDF installation (default: NETCDF
                          environment)
  --with-hdf5             Path to HDF5 installation (default: HDF5
                          environment)
  --with-szip             Path to SZIP installation (default: SZIP
                          environment)
  CC=         C compiler command
  CFLAGS=     C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS=    linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  LIBS=       libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
  CPPFLAGS=   (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CPP=        C preprocessor
  FC=         Fortran compiler command
  FCFLAGS=    Fortran compiler flags
  MPIFC=      MPI Fortran compiler command
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Model configuration at build stage}
\label{modconf}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Enable debug
\begin{Verbatim}
  --enable-debug     Enable debugging flags and per processor log file
\end{Verbatim}
If enabled, the model will be compiled using debug flags for the compiler,
which will allow the use of a debugger such as gdb. More diagnostics will
also be generated during model run.
The default is to build production binaries with all optimization flags
turned on.

\item Serial code using stub MPI library
\begin{Verbatim}
  --enable-mpiserial Use the included MPI replacement library for single
                     processor
\end{Verbatim}
The model is coded to use an MPI2 library to run in parallel mode using
multiple cores/processors or run on a cluster. To enable instead a serial
compilation option, a stub MPI library with empty callbacks needs to be
compiled and linked to the executable.
The RegCM team strongly suggest to build MPI enabled model also on standalone
systems, to take advantage of the multicore capabilities of any modern
processor.
\item CLM option
\begin{Verbatim}
  --enable-clm       Supply this option if you plan on using CLM option.
\end{Verbatim}
This option switches off the default Land model of RegCM (derived from BATS1e),
and enables the use of the Community Land Model V3.5 inside RegCM. The default
is to use the RegCM BATS Land Model.
\item CLM 4.5 option
\begin{Verbatim}
  --enable-clm45     Supply this option if you plan on using CLM45 option.
\end{Verbatim}
This option switches off the default Land model of RegCM (derived from BATS1e),
and enables the use of the Community Land Model V4.5 inside RegCM. The default
is to use the RegCM BATS Land Model.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Build the model executables}

Now that everything is hopefully configured, you may use the \verb=make=
program to build executables.

\begin{Verbatim}
$> make
\end{Verbatim}

This target will builds all model parts. 
The compilation is started in the whole model tree (PreProc, Main and PostProc).
Lot of messages will appear on screen, abd at the end all executables are built
int the source directories.
To copy them to a \verb=bin= directory in the model root or into a \verb=bin=
directory in the path specified with the prefix argument to the \verb=configure=
script, esplicitly issue the command:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> make install
\end{Verbatim}

Congratulations! You can now go to next step and run a test simulation.
