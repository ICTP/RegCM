\section{The GitHub site}

On the GitHub site it is offered a convenient interface to report issues with
the RegCM model code at:

\begin{Verbatim}
https://github.com/ICTP/RegCM/issues
\end{Verbatim}

Non ICTP users are invited to submit issues through this interace. As usual,
you are invited to be kind and provide any information requested. Possibly,
the solution to the problem will be implemented in the development code.
Don't forget though to close the issues when a solution is possible, and if
you solve yurself the problem report the solution you have found to eventually
help other RegCM users!
