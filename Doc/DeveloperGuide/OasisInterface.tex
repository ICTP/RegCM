\chapter{The Oasis Interface}

This interface was developped in \PR with \OA\ (see the module's user guide:
\cite{valcke_oasis}).

\section{Oasis-related code}

Are listed below the sections of the code which are related to the use of Oasis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	the library \verb=oasislib=, needing only \verb=Share= and \verb=mpplib=;
	\item 	the module \verb=mod_oasis_interface.F90=, which links all \verb=oasislib=
		processes with the model's variables, and transfers the needed
		accessibility to \verb=oasislib= parameters (in the rest of the code,
		one only need to \verb=use mod_oasis_interface.F90=);
	\item	some accessibility changes in \verb=mod_lm_interface.F90=;
	\item	several lines in \verb=mod_params.F90= for reading the \verb=oasisparam=
		namelist (and the parameter \verb=ioasiscpl= is added to the
		\verb=physicsparam= namelist);
	\item	several lines in \verb=mod_regcm_interface.F90= for calling the needed
		subroutines along the run;
	\item	several lines in \verb=regcm.F90= for implementing the MPI initialization
		of Oasis;
	\item	appropriate lines in the \verb=Main='s \verb=Makefiles.am=;
	\item	several lines in \verb=configure.ac= for the configuration options.
\end{itemize}

Oasis-related sections are enabled only if the builder is configured with
the option \verb=--enable-oasis=. In the code, these sections (except for the parameter
\verb=ioasiscpl= which is in \verb=physicsparam= anyways) are inserted within
\begin{verbatim}
#ifdef OASIS
 ! Something to be done only in Oasis mode
#endif
\end{verbatim}

\section{Adding fields}

The interface is not exclusively for handling air-sea interactions, even though it was
initially developped for it. Indeed, its types, variables, and subroutines remain quite
general, such that one could for instance implement another exchange grid, and/or set up
the fields which are needed for a precise coupling experiment.

The locations where lines should be added for implementing new fields are notified with
the comment \verb=! OASIS field +++=, which may be \verb=grep=ped...

Any interaction between fields from OASIS and the model's variables should be done in
\verb=mod_oasis_interface.F90=, where developpers are invited to use the model's variables
which are already public. However, if access to private variables is needed because
the projected coupling cannot be conducted otherwise, accessibility changes may be done.
An example can be found in \verb=mod_lm_interface.F90=:
\begin{verbatim}
  public :: lms
#ifdef OASIS
  public :: lm
#endif
\end{verbatim}

Finally, simply adding a field should not need changes in the \verb=oasislib=, although
consulting it may be useful for understanding then handling all types, variables and
subroutines. Explicit comments are normally present in the code.
