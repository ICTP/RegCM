\section{Model Developer}

If you plan to become a model developer, it is suggested to fork the RegCM
repository:

\begin{Verbatim}
https://t.ly/iP0G-
\end{Verbatim}

The RegCM team strongly encourages the contributing developers to frequently
pull the modifications from the master repository, because the RegCM is
actively developed by the ICTP and collaborators.

Check that {\bf git} software is installed on your machine typing
the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
$> git --version
\end{verbatim}
