We will examine in this chapter in more detail the namelist configuration file,
to give you the User a deeper knowledge of model capabilities.

\section{The commented namelist}

In this section we will show you the commented namelist input file you will
find under \verb=$REGCM_ROOT/Doc= with the name \verb=README.namelist= .
All model programs seen so far, with the exception of the GrADS helper program,
use as input this namelist file, which is unique to a particular simulation.
The model input namelist file is divided in stanzas, each one devoted to
configuring the model capabilities.
A stanza in the namelist is identified with a starting \verb=&= character
followed by stanza name, and ends on a single line with the \verb=\=
character.

\subsection{dimparam stanza}
\label{dimparam}

This stanza contains the base X,Y,Z domain dimension information, used
by the model dynamic memory allocator to request the Operating System the
memory space to store the model internal variables.

{\footnotesize
\begin{Verbatim}
 &dimparam
 iy     = 34,   ! This is number of points in the N/S direction
 jx     = 48,   ! This is number of points in the E/W direction
 kz     = 18,   ! Number of vertical levels
 dsmin  = 0.01, ! Minimum sigma spacing (only used if kz is not 14, 18, or 23)
 dsmax  = 0.05, ! Maximum sigma spacing (only used if kz is not 14, 18, or 23)
 nsg    = 1,    ! For subgridding, number of points to decompose. If nsg=1,
                ! no subgridding is performed. CLM does NOT work as of now with
                ! subgridding enabled.
 /
\end{Verbatim}
}

The things you need to know here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In the current version 4.3 the model parallelizes execution dividing
the work between the processors, with the minimum work per processor is 9
points or a box $3*3$, so the maximum number of processors which can be used
in a parallel run for the above configuration is roughly $180$.
\item If a custom number of sigma level is chosen (not 14, 18 or 23), the actual
sigma values are calculated mimimizing the $a,b$ coefficients for the 
equation:

\begin{equation}
  dsig(i) = dsmax*a^{i-1}*b^{0.5*(i-2)*(i-1)}
\end{equation}

derived from the recursive relation:

\begin{equation}
  dsig(i) = a(i)*dsig(i-1)
\end{equation}

where $a(i) = b*a(i-1)$. We at ICTP normally use 18 levels.
\item Specifying an nsg number greater than one triggers the subgrid BATS model
on. There is no plan to extend this feature to CLM model. This affects only
surface variable calculations. All dynamical variables are calculated still
on the coarser grid. Rain in the current implementation is also calculated on
the coarser grid.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{geoparam stanza}
\label{geoparam}

This stanza is used by the \verb=terrain= program to geolocate the model grid
on the earth surface. The RegCM model uses a limited number of projection
engines. The value here are used by the other model programs to assert
consistency with the geolocation information written by the \verb=terrain=
program in the \verb=DOMAIN= file.

The first step in any application is the selection of model domain and
resolution. There are no strict rules for this selection, which in fact is
mostly determined by the nature of the problem and the availability of
computing resources. The domain should be large enough to allow the model to
develop its own circulations and to include all relevant forcings and
processes, and the resolution should be high enough to capture local processes
of interest (e.g. due to complex topography or land surface).

On the other hand the model computational cost increases rapidly with
resolution and domain size, so a compromise needs to be usually reached
between all these factors.

This is usually achieved by experience, understanding of the problem or
trial and error, however one tip to remember is to avoid that the boundaries
of the domain cross major topographical systems.

This is because the mismatch in the resolution of the coarse scale lateral
driving fields and the model fields in the presence of steep topography may
generate spurious local effects (e.g. localized precipitation areas) which can
affect the model behavior, at least in adjacent areas.

 /
\end{Verbatim}
}

The things you need to know here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The different projection engines produce better results depending on the
position and extent of the domain. In particular, regardless of hemisphere:
\begin{itemize}
\item Middle latitudes (around 45 degrees) - Lambert Conformal
\item Polar latitudes (more than 75 degrees) - Polar Stereographic
\item Low latitudes (up to 30 degrees and crossing the equator) - Mercator
\item Crossing more than 45 degrees extent in latitude - Rotated Mercator
\end{itemize}
\item The model hydrostatic engine does not allow a resolution lower than
$20 km$. If you want a higher resolution consider using the subgridding scheme.
ICTP plans to introduce in the future a non-hydrostatic compressible core to
the RegCM model.
\item Lowering the top pressure of the model can give you problems in regions
with complex topography. Touch the default after thinking twice on that.
\item Always specify \verb=clat= and \verb=clon=, the central domain point,
and do fine adjustment of the position moving it around a little bit. A
little shift in position and some tests can help you obtain a better
representation of coastlines and topography at the coarse resolutions.
\item If using \verb=LAMCON= projection, take care to place the two
true latitudes at around one fourth and three fourth of the domain latitude
space to better correct the projection distortion of the domain.
\item The pole position for the rotated mercator position should be as near as
possible to the center domain position.
\item For the \verb=i_band= parameter, selecting this will enable the tropical
band experiment, and the horizontal resolution will be calculated from the
number of jx points.
The projection is set to Normal Mercator, the center of the projection is set
to \verb'clat = 0.0', \verb'clon = 180.0',
and the grid point resolution is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{2*\pi*6370.0}{jx}
\end{equation}
Just remember:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The model for a tropical band simulation is heavy, as the number of points
is usually huge to obtain a good horizontal resolution. Check any memory
limit is disabled on your platform before attempting a run.
\item The model scales well on a cluster with a large number of processors.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{terrainparam stanza}
\label{terparam}
This stanza is used by the \verb=terrain= program to know how you want
to generate the \verb=DOMAIN= file. You can control its work using a number of
parameters to obtain what you consider the best representation of the
physical reality. Do not underestimate what you can do at this early stage,
having a good representation of the surface can lead to valuable results
later when the model calculates climatic parameters.

{\footnotesize
\begin{Verbatim}
 &terrainparam

 fudge_tex   = .false.,  ! Fudging Control flag, for texture of grid
 fudge_tex_s = .false.,  ! Fudging Control flag, for texture of subgrid
 fudge_lak   = .false.,  ! Fudging Control flag, for lake of grid
 fudge_lak_s = .false.,  ! Fudging Control flag, for lake of subgrid
 h2opct = 50.,           ! Surface minimum H2O percent to be considered water
 h2ohgt = .false.,       ! Allow water points to have elevation greater than 0
 dirter = 'input/',      ! Output directory for terrain files
 inpter = 'globdata/',   ! Input directory for SURFACE dataset
 /
\end{Verbatim}
}

The things you need to know here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \verb=domname= will control the output file naming convention, all
generated files will add this prefix to the old V3 naming convention,
giving you the capability to recognize different runs. Try to use always
meaningful names.
\item You can control the final land-water mask using the h2opct parameter.
This parameter can be used to have more land points than calculated by
the simple interpolation engine. Try it with different values to find best
land shapes. A zero value means use just the interpolation engine, higher
values will extend into ocean points the land at land-water interface.
The h2ohgt parameter allows also water points to have elevation greater
than zero to avoid wall effects on the coasts.
\item A number of flags control the capability of the \verb=terrain= program
to modify on request the class type variables in the \verb=DOMAIN= file. You can
modify on request the landuse, the texture and the lake/land interface.
Running once the \verb=terrain= program, it will generate for you aside from the
\verb=DOMAIN= file a series of ASCII files you can modify with any text
editor. Running the \verb=terrain= program the second time and setting
a \verb=fudge= flag, will tell the program to overwrite the selected
variable with the modified value in the ASCII file. This can be useful
for sensitivity experiments in the BATS surface model or to design
a scenario experiment.
\item Some of the land surface types in BATS have been little tested and used
or are extremely simplified and thus should be used cautiously. Specifically
the types are: sea ice, bog/marsh, irrigated crop, glacier. If such types are
present in a domain, the user is advised to carefully check the model behavior
at such points and eventually substitute these types with others.
\item The \verb=inpter= directory is expected to contain a \verb=SURFACE=
directory where the actual netCDF global dataset are stored. The overall
path is limited to $256$ characters.
\label{pathnote}
\item If the netCDF library is compiled with OpenDAP support, an URL
can be used as a path in the \verb=dirter= and \verb=inpter= variables.
Note that the $256$ character limit for paths holds in the whole program.
For \verb=terrain= program you may want to try the following URL: \\
http://clima-dods.ictp.it/thredds/dodsC
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{debugparam stanza}

This stanza is used by all RegCM programs to enable/disable some debug printout.
In the current release this flag is honored only by the model itself. If you
are not a developer you may find this flags useless.

{\footnotesize
\begin{Verbatim}
 &debugparam
 debug_level = 0, ! Currently value of 2 and 3 control previous DIAG flag
 dbgfrq = 3,      ! Interval for printout if debug_level >= 3
 /
\end{Verbatim}
}

Just note that with current implementation, the output file syncing is left
to the netCDF library. If You want to examine step by step the output while
the model is running, set the \verb=debug_level= at value 3.

\subsection{boundaryparam stanza}

Being a limited area model, in order to be run RegCM4 requires the provision
of meteorological initial and time dependent lateral boundary conditions,
typically for wind components, temperature, water vapor and surface pressure.
These are obtained by interpolation from output from reanalysis of observations
or global climate model simulations, which thus “drive” the regional climate
model.

The lateral boundary conditions (LBC) are provided through the so called
relaxation/diffusion technique which consists of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item selecting a lateral buffer zone of n grid point width (\verb=nspgx=)
\item interpolating the driving large scale fields onto the model grid
\item applying the relaxation + diffusion term
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial t} = F(n)F_1 * (\alpha_{LBC}-\alpha_{mod}) -
    F(n)F2 * \Delta_2(\alpha_{LBC}-\alpha_{mod})
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a prognostic variable (wind components, temperature, water
vapor, surface pressure). The first term on the rhs is a Newtonian relaxation
term which brings the model solution ($mod$) towards the LBC field ($LBC$)
and the second term diffuses the differences between model solution and LBC.
$F(n)$ is an exponential function given by:
\begin{equation}
F(n) = exp\left(\frac{-(n-1)}{anudge(k)}\right)
\end{equation}
Where $n$ is the grid point distance from the boundary (varying from $1$ to
$nspgx$): $n-1$ is the outermost grid point, $n=2$ the adjacent one etc.
The $anudge$ array determines the strength of the LBC forcing and depends on
the model level $k$. In practice $F(n)$ is equal to 1 at the outermost grid
point row and decreases exponentially to $0$ at the internal edge of the buffer
zone ($nspgd$) at a rate determined by $anudge$. Larger buffer zones and larger
values of $anudge$ will yield a greater forcing by the LBC.  
\end{enumerate}

Typically for domain sizes of $~100$ grid points we use a buffer zone width
of $10-12$ grid points, for large domains this buffer zone can increase to
values of $15$ or even $20$.

In the model $anudge$ has three increasing values from the lower, to the mid
and higher troposphere. For example for $nspgx = 10$ we use $anudge$ equals to
$1, 2, 3$ for the lower, mid and upper troposphere, respectively.

This allows a stronger forcing in the upper troposphere to insure a greater
consistency of large scale circulations with the forcing LBC while allowing
more freedom to the model in the lower troposphere where local high resolution
forcings (e.g. complex topography) are more important.

For nspgx of $15-20$, for example, $anudge$ values could be increased to
$2,3,4$. As a rule of thumb, the choice of the maximum $anudge$ value should
follow the conditions:

\begin{equation}
\frac{(nspgx-1)}{anudge(k)} \ge 3
\end{equation}

{\footnotesize
\begin{Verbatim}
 &boundaryparam
 nspgx  = 12, ! nspgx-1 represent the number of cross point slices on
              ! the boundary sponge or relaxation boundary conditions.
 nspgd  = 12, ! nspgd-1 represent the number of dot point slices on
              ! the boundary sponge or relaxation boundary conditions.
 high_nudge   =     3.0, ! Nudge value high range
 medium_nudge =     2.0, ! Nudge value medium range
 low_nudge    =     1.0  ! Nudge value low range

\subsection{globdatparam stanza}

This stanza is used by the \verb=sst= and \verb=icbc= ICBC programs. You can
tell them how to build initial and bondary conditions.

                   ! on how to download them.
 /
\end{Verbatim}
}

Things you need to know here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The gdate time window to build ICBC must be always greater or equal to
the time window you plan to run the model in.
Different GCMs and reanalysis products have different length of the year.
For example, the reanalysis products employ the real year length (365 days +
real leap years, i.e. and average length of 365.2422), the CCSM has a length
of 365 days (no leap year), the HadCM has a length of 360 days (30 day months).
The RegCM4 length of the year has to be the same as in the forcing fields, and
this can be set in the variable \verb=dayspy=.
Please remember to always check the consistency of the length of the year.
\item Even if listed, not all the input engines are fully tested. Some of them
need data which have been reformatted by ICTP (they are not in the original
format with which they are distributed by the institution producing them).
Some input data are not freely distibutable by ICTP, and you need a special
agreement with the owner to use them.
Hopefully the situation is changing, and data exchange is becoming more and more
the basis for good science in the climatic field.
\item For notes on path, you can see the above in terrainparam stanza
description at \ref{pathnote}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{perturbparam stanza}

This stanza lets you control to which input field and of what fractional
level a perturbation is added at ICBC stage on the input fields.
It is read by the ICBC program if the \verb=ensemble_run= parameter in the
\verb=globdatparam= stanza is set to \verb=true=.

{\footnotesize
\begin{Verbatim}

 perturb_frac_v  = 0.001D0,   ! Fractional value of the perturbation on v
 /
\end{Verbatim}
}

Things you need to know here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \verb=perturb_frac= should not exceed a percent of the field value.
The algorithm detail of the applied noise can be found in \cite{tao_ense}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{restartparam stanza}

This stanza lets you control the time period the model is currently simulating
in this particular run. You may want to split longer runs for which you have
prepared the ICBC's into shorter runs, to schedule HPC resource usage in a more
collaborative way with other researcher sharing it: the regcm model allows
restart, so be friendly with other research projects which may not have this
fortune (unless you are late for publication).

{\footnotesize
\begin{Verbatim}
 &restartparam
 ifrest  = .false. ,   ! If a restart
 mdate0  = 1990060100, ! Global start (is gdate1, most probably)
 mdate1  = 1990060100, ! Start date of this run
 mdate2  = 1990060200, ! End date for this run
 /
\end{Verbatim}
}

Things you need to know here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item After the simulation starts, on restart NEVER change the \verb=mdate0=
value. The correct scheme for restart is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set \verb=ifrest= to \verb=.true.=
\item Set \verb=mdate1= to the value in \verb=mdate2=
\item Define the new value for \verb=mdate2=
\end{itemize}
\item Consider that current RegCM convention is to place midnight of first
day of month as the last timestep in previous month, except on first model
output file (\verb=ifrest= = \verb=.false.=). It is for this reason better
to use as start and end time a month boundary. We usually consider a month
data file the basic unit of output, each time you cross a month a new output
file will be created for you.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{timeparam stanza}

This stanza contains model internal timesteps, used by the model as basic
integration timestep and triggers for calling internal parametric schemes.

{\footnotesize
\begin{Verbatim}
 &timeparam
 dt     =   150., ! time step in seconds
 dtrad  =    30., ! time interval solar radiation calculated (minutes)
 dtabem =    18., ! time interval absorption-emission calculated (hours)
 dtsrf  =   600., ! time interval at which land model is called (seconds)
 /
\end{Verbatim}
}

Things you need to know here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The dynamical hydrostatical core of RegCM requires a fixed timestep,
and you need to manually find the correct value which permits not to break
the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition considering \cite{CFL}. A good rule
of thumb is to have a \verb=dt= not greater than three times the \verb=ds=
value in $km$ specified in the \verb=geoparam= stanza at \ref{geoparam}.
A greater value may lower computing time, but in case of strong advection
may lead to non accurate computation or even the violation of CFL condition
and the divergence of the solution.
\item All the other internal timesteps need to be multiples of the base timestep.
Note that the units are different, so you need to convert the other timesteps
in seconds before the check.
\item In case of strong surface gradients, a low value for the surface timesteps
may help the model better describe the interaction with the atmosphere and
obtain a stable solution.
\item If you hit a non stable condition, the restart capability of the model
may help find the correct timestep just for a particular period, using a
different timestep at different times.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{outparam stanza}

This stanza controls the model output engine, allowing you to enable/disable
any of the output file writeout, or to modify the frequency the fields are
written in the files.

{\footnotesize

Things you need to know here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The surface fields are the mean values in the interval specified by
the frequency values. The dynamical fields are instead the point value at the
output time. Refer to the Reference Manual \cite{refman_11} for a detailed
description of the model output fields.
\item If the chemistry or lake model are not enabled, the values specified in
the control flags are not considered. If \verb=nsg= is not greater than one
in dimparam at \ref{dimparam}, the \verb=ifsub= flag is not considered.
\item For the output directory, the path variable has a limit of $256$
characters. This path must be a local path on disk where the user running
the model has write permissions granted.
\item The enablevar logical arrays can be used to avoid saving one of the time
dependent variables in the output file, in the order they are saved in the
output file itself. Note that geolocation and pressure variables cannot be
disabled.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{physicsparam stanza}
\label{physicsparam}

This stanza controls the model physics. You have a number of option here,
and the best way to select the right set is to carefully read the the
Reference Manual \cite{refman_11}. We are for the purposes of this User Guide
not going in detail in here, except in saying that probably you will need
to run some experiments especially with different cumulus convection
schemes before finding out the best model setting.
Although the mixed convection scheme (Grell over land and Emanuel over ocean)
seems to provide an overall better performance, our experience is that there
is no scheme that works best everywhere, therefore we advice to always do some
sensitivity experiments to select the best scheme for your application.

The \verb=chemsimtype= parameter select one in a number of fixed sets which
define the nature and number of chemical species and/or transported aerosols,
together with wich relevant scheme is to be used in the simulation.
The implemented possible simulation types for the aerosol/chemistry options
are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \verb=DUST= : Activate 4 dust bins scheme, with on line emission,
    transport and removal.
  \item \verb=SSLT= : Activate 2 sea salt bins scheme, with on line emission,
    transport and removal.
  \item \verb=CARB= : Activate 4 species organic and black carbon in both
    hydrophobic and hydrophilic aerosol scheme, with on line emission,
    transport and removal.
  \item \verb=SULF= : Activate SO2 and SO4 tracers with simple sulfate
    oxidation from oxidant climatology, with on line emission,
    transport and removal.
  \item \verb=SUCA= : Activate both SULF and CARB.
  \item \verb=AERO= : Activate all DUST, SSLT, CARB and SULF
  \item \verb=CBMZ= : Activate CBMZ gas phase option : 35 tracer are
    considered here.
  \item \verb=DCBB= : Activate CBMZ +DUST +CARB options: 45 tracers are
    considered here.
\end{enumerate}

The more tracer are used, the heavier computationally are the simulations and
the outputs. The chemistry outputs consist of one netCDF file per tracer,
named explicitely and containing concentration fields + different diagnostics,
and one netCDF file giving the optical properties of the total aerosol mixture
i.e. aerosol optical depth and radiative forcing. For a big domain, this can
require a huge amount of disk space to store the model results.

We will now detail the steps required to run a chemistry/aerosol simulation with
the RegCM model.

\subsubsection{Pre Processing}

We need to perform a couple of operations in the pre-processing stage to prepare
input datasets for an aerosol/chemistry simulation.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the case of a \verb=DUST=, \verb=AERO= or \verb=DCBB= simulation,
    we need the model to prepare soil type dataset to be used for dust emission
    calculation at the \verb=terrain= program stage. The \verb=ltexture=
    parameter in the \verb=terrainparam= stanza (see above in \ref{terparam})
    should be set to \verb=.true.=.
  \item After having prepared the static and boundary condition data with the
    \verb=icbc= program for the atmosphere, we need also to define chemical
    emissions and chemical boundary conditions.
\end{enumerate}

The data needed for this second task come from different sources, both
measurements data or GCM model with a chemistry parametrization active.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Emission dataset. The pre processor can manage CMIP5 RCP anthropogenic
    emissions for present day and future emission. For this, the global RCP
    emission dataset have first been processed by ICTP (F.Solmon and A. Pozzer)
    to match the species considered in the chemical solver CBMZ, and to
    aggregate different sector of emissions that are present in the RCP fields
    (e.g. CO emission from biomass burning + fossil fuel + ship + $\ldots$).
    The resulting global files, as well as grid informations are publicly
    available on ICTP site :
    \begin{center}
    \verb=http://clima-dods.ictp.it/data/d8/cordex/RCP_EMGLOB_PROCESSED=
    \end{center}
    Note : not the whole RCP have been yet processed and put on the website,
    but this will be done progressively. At this time you can use only
    1990-2010 Historical emissions.
  \item Chemical boundary conditions for important tracersare available through
    ICTP. We use monthly boundary condition coming from global simulations
    (CAM + EC-EARTH) for aerosols, following different RCP scenarios
    (HIST + future).
    For the gas phase, we however still rely on a climatology representative
    of monthly average concentrations over the period 2000-2007 coming from
    the MOZART CTM. In the future, we hope to have also GCM forcing interface
    for relevant gas phase species. The oxidant fields, used in the simple
    sulfate scheme, is also a climatology coming from MOZART CTM.
    The data are available on ICTP site in the folloving directories:
    \begin{Verbatim}
    http://clima-dods.ictp.it/data/d8/cordex/AERGLOB
    http://clima-dods.ictp.it/data/d8/cordex/OXIGLOB
    \end{Verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

The steps to prepare the chemistry boundary conditions data are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In case of a chemistry simulation type (\verb=CBMZ= or \verb=DCBB=), the
    global emission files must first be interpolate to the RegCM model grid
    using the following procedure:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Create the RegCM model grid description file to be used by
        \verb=cdo= to calculate weghts for a conservative remapping
        interpolation:
        \begin{Verbatim}
        $> cd $REGCM_RUN
        $> ./bin/emcre_grid test_001.in
        \end{Verbatim}
      \item Interpolate the global data on the RegCM grid with the interpolation
        script:
        \begin{Verbatim}
        $> cd $REGCM_RUN
        $> ./bin/interp_emissions test_001.in
        \end{Verbatim}
    \end{itemize}
    The \verb=cdo= program installation is mandatory in this case to perform
    this step. The interpolation is mass conservative and is consistent for
    any ratio of model resolution/global emission resolution.
    Note the programs and script uses the same root path of \verb=terrain= and
    \verb=icbc= programs for input and data directory. By default, we expect
    the global emission to be at the same level than e.g. EIN15 in your data
    path layout.
    This results in a file named \verb=*_CHEMISS.nc= of monthly emission for
    the whole RCP period. You don’t need to reprocess the file if you change
    the date of your simulation, as long as you are in the RCP temporal windows
    (for now, Historical from 1990-2010) .
    Which scenario to use is controlled by the \verb=scenario= variable in the
    \verb=physicsparam= parameter stanza as above in \ref{physicsparam}
  \item In function of the value of the \verb=chemsimtype= parameter, the
    relevant boundary conditions will be produced on the RegCM domain by
    running :
        \begin{Verbatim}
        $> cd $REGCM_RUN
        $> ./bin/chem_icbc test_001.in
        \end{Verbatim}
    That will result in 6 hourly chemical boundary conditions in your input
    directory (\verb=*_CHBC*.nc= and/or \verb=*_AEBC*.nc=). We are generating
    6 hourly outputs from monthly global fields because we are anticipating
    working soon with 6 hourly global outputs. There is indeed a bit of a
    waste of space right now.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Run time parameters}
The other \verb=chemparam= stanza parameters, let you control run time behaviour
of the model chemistry and aerosol schemes.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \verb=ichsolver= : relevant for gas-phase chemistry options, activate
    the chemical solver CBMZ. If different from $1$, there is no chemical
    reactions and the tracer are only emitted, transported and removed.
  \item \verb=ichsursrc= : if set different from $1$, the emission term is
    suppressed and only boundary conditions are generating tracer in the domain.
  \item \verb=ichdrdepo= : if set different from $1$, the dry deposition and
    sedimentation of tracers is disabled for chemistry species.
  \item \verb=ichremlsc= : if set different from $1$, wet removal of chemical
    species (washout and rainout by total rain) is disabled.
  \item \verb=ichcumtra= : if set different form $1$, the convective transport
    of tracers is disabled.
  \item= \verb=ichdiag= : if set to $1$, the writing of additional diagnostics
    in the chemistry output is enabled. Particularly, all the 3D tendency terms
    (advection, turbulence, convection, boundary condition, chemistry, removal,
    etc.) of the tracer equation are outputted at the frequency \verb=ichfreq=.
    This is usefull for budget and sensitivity studies, as well as debugging.
    This potentially can generate HUGE files.
  \item \verb=idirect= : Enable or disable aerosol feedbacks on radiation.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item if equal to $1$, only aerosol radiative forcing is calculated and
        outputted but there is NO aerosol radiative feedback on climate.
        This can be viewed as a control run option.
      \item if equal to $2$, there is a feedback of aerosol radiative forcing
        on climate fields, via perturbation of the temperature tendency.
        This can be view as the perturbed run option.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \verb=ichdustemd= : Choice for parametrisation of dust emission size
    distribution:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item if set to $1$, the standard scheme s used (Alfaro et al.,
        Zakey et al., 2006)
      \item if set to $2$, the revised soil granulometry + Kok et al., 2011
        emission size distribution is used.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \verb=rdstemfac= : Scaling factor for \verb=DUST= emission flux
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Sparse notes}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Outputs are in netCDF, so process with your favorite software.
  \item The flux and tendency variables, as well as radiative forcings,
    are accumulated and averaged between 2 output time steps (like
    precipitations). The concentration, burden and aerosol optical depth
    are instantaneous.
  \item The outputs size can be huge, especially for full chemistry and
    diagnostic options. In the future, we might have the choice of outputting
    selected variables only.
\end{enumerate}

Not every possible dynamical configuration has been tested for the chemistry
option, so bugs might appear: please report!
CLM enables to calculate on line biogenic volatile hydrocarbon emissions, as
well as chemical deposition that can be used in RegCM. There are some flags to
activate when compiling CLM, we will update the documentation when fully tested.

The Tiedke and Emmanuel schemes, when activated, offer a more detailed
treatment of convective transport than the simple mixing hypothesis used with
other schemes.
The UW planetary boundary layer option integrate directly the emission and
deposition flux terms as part of the calculation of trurbulent tracer tendency.

\section{The CLM options}
\label{clm}

We will now discuss from the user point of view how to use the model
setup which need to be activated at configure stage.

The \verb=CLM= option if activated allows the user to run a simulation using
the CLM surface model instead of the default BATS1e model. We will not here go
in deep in the difference between the two models, read the Reference Manual
for this.
The executable of the model is different in the case of the \verb=CLM=, and is
named \verb=regcmMPI_clm=.
Note that in the CLM case only the MPI enabled compilation is supported (no
serial), and no subgridding is possible (\verb=nsg= is always $1$).

\subsubsection{Enable}

At configure stage (see \ref{modconf}), the option is to be enabled with the
right command line argument to the configure script

\begin{Verbatim}
  --enable-clm            Supply this option if you plan on using CLM option.
\end{Verbatim}

This will enable a preprocessing flag, and build a different model executable.
Note that no modifications are needed for any other part of the model, but
this triggers the building of another pre-processing program, \verb=clm2rcm=.

\subsubsection{Prepare and run}
\label{clmrun}

The \verb=CLM= configuration requires a separate stanza in the namelist input
file.

{\footnotesize
\begin{Verbatim}
 &clmparam
 dirclm = 'input/', ! CLM path to Input data produced by clm2rcm. If 
                    ! relative, It should be how to reach the Input dir
                    ! from the Run dir.
 clmfrq =  12.,     ! Frequency for CLM own output write
 imask  =   1,      ! For CLM, Type of land surface parameterization
                    !   1 => using DOMAIN.INFO for landmask (same as BATS)
                    !   2 => using mksrf_navyoro file landfraction for
                    !        landmask and perform a weighted average over
                    !        ocean/land gridcells; for example:
                    ! tgb = tgb_ocean*(1-landfraction)+tgb_land*landfraction
 /
\end{Verbatim}
}

Things you need to know here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \verb=inpter= path defined in \verb=terrainparam= stanza described in
\ref{terparam} is used also by the \verb=clm2rcm= program. See at \ref{clmdata}
how to obtain needed datasets.
\item The file \verb=pft-physiology.c070207= should be manually copied in the
\verb=dirclm= directory before running the model.
\item The clmfrq is relative to the output produced by the \verb=CLM= model
itself, and does not control the RegCM model output. To know the \verb=CLM=
output file content, refer to CLM 3.5 documentation.
\item The \verb'imask = 2' option cannot be used with the \verb'icup'
cumulus convection schemes $2, 98, 99$, which rely on the BATS1e landmask.
\end{enumerate}

In the case of \verb=CLM= run, the user needs to run, after the \verb=terrain=
program, the \verb=clm2rcm= program, and copy the \verb=pft-physiology.c070207=
in the input directory:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> cd $REGCM_RUN
$> ./bin/terrain regcm.in
$> ./bin/clm2rcm regcm.in
$> cp $REGCM_GLOBEDAT/CLM/pft-physiology.c070207 input/
\end{Verbatim}

The \verb=clm2rcm= program interpolates global land characteristics datasets
to the RegCM projected grid. The content of the \verb=pft-physiology.c070207=
file are described in the \verb=pft-physiology.c070207.readme= file.
All the other pre-processing steps are just equal to the one detailed in
chapter \ref{tutorial}. To run the \verb=CLM= option in the RegCM model, just
substitute the executable name:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> mpirun -np 2 ./bin/regcmMPI_clm regcm.in
\end{Verbatim}

Note that the \verb=CLM= land model is much heavier than the BATS1e model, and
computing time increases.

\section{Sensitivity experiments hint}

Although the LBC forcing does provide a constraint for the model, as any RCM,
RegCM4 is characterized by a certain level of internal variability due to its
non-liner processes (e.g. convection).

For example, if small perturbations are introduced in the initial or lateral
boundary conditions, the model will generally produce different patterns of,
e.g. precipitation, that appear as (sometimes seemingly organized) noise when
compared to the control simulation.

This noise depends on domain size and climatic regimes, for example it is
especially pronounced in warm climate regimes (e.g. tropics or during the
summer season) and large doamins.

When doing for example sensitivity experiments to model modifications, e.g. to
land use change, this internal variability “noise” can be misinterpreted as a
model response to the factor modified.

Users of RegCM4 should be aware of this when they do sensitivity experiments.
The best way to filter out this noise is to perform ensembles of simulations
and lok at the ensemble averages to extract the real model response from the
noise.
