!     Explanation of the method for each value of INFLAG.  Values of
!     0 or 1 for INFLAG do not distingish being liquid and ice clouds.
!     INFLAG = 2 does distinguish between liquid and ice clouds, and
!     requires further user input to specify the method to be used to
!     compute the aborption due to each.
!     INFLAG = 0:  For each cloudy layer, the cloud fraction and (gray)
!                  optical depth are input.
!     INFLAG = 1:  For each cloudy layer, the cloud fraction and cloud
!                  water path (g/m2) are input.  The (gray) cloud optical
!                  depth is computed as in CCM2.
!     INFLAG = 2:  For each cloudy layer, the cloud fraction, cloud
!                  water path (g/m2), and cloud ice fraction are input.
!       ICEFLAG = 0:  The ice effective radius (microns) is input and the
!                     optical depths due to ice clouds are computed as in CCM3.
!       ICEFLAG = 1:  The ice effective radius (microns) is input and the
!                     optical depths due to ice clouds are computed as in
!                     Ebert and Curry, JGR, 97, 3831-3836 (1992).  The
!                     spectral regions in this work have been matched with
!                     the spectral bands in RRTM to as great an extent
!                     as possible:
!                     E&C 1      IB = 5      RRTM bands 9-16
!                     E&C 2      IB = 4      RRTM bands 6-8
!                     E&C 3      IB = 3      RRTM bands 3-5
!                     E&C 4      IB = 2      RRTM band 2
!                     E&C 5      IB = 1      RRTM band 1
!       ICEFLAG = 2:  The ice effective radius (microns) is input and the
!                     optical properties due to ice clouds are computed from
!                     the optical properties stored in the RT code,
!                     STREAMER v3.0 (Reference: Key. J., Streamer
!                     User's Guide, Cooperative Institute for
!                     Meteorological Satellite Studies, 2001, 96 pp.).
!                     Valid range of values for re are between 5.0 and
!                     131.0 micron.
!       ICEFLAG = 3: The ice generalized effective size (dge) is input
!                    and the optical properties, are calculated as in
!                    Q. Fu, J. Climate, (1998). Q. Fu provided high resolution
!                    tables which were appropriately averaged for the
!                    bands in RRTM_LW.  Linear interpolation is used to
!                    get the coefficients from the stored tables.
!                    Valid range of values for dge are between 5.0 and
!                    140.0 micron.
!       LIQFLAG = 0:  The optical depths due to water clouds are computed as
!                     in CCM3.
!       LIQFLAG = 1:  The water droplet effective radius (microns) is input
!                     and the optical depths due to water clouds are computed
!                     as in Hu and Stamnes, J., Clim., 6, 728-742, (1993).
!                     The values for absorption coefficients appropriate for
!                     the spectral bands in RRTM have been obtained for a
!                     range of effective radii by an averaging procedure
!                     based on the work of J. Pinto (private communication).
!                     Linear interpolation is used to get the absorption
!                     coefficients for the input effective radius.
