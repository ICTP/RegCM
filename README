ICTP Regional Climate Model
============================

 The Regional Climate Model system RegCM, originally developed at the National
 Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is maintained in the Earth System
 Physics (ESP) section of the ICTP. The first version of the model, RegCM1,
 was developed in 1989 and since then it has undergone major updates in 1993
 (RegCM2), 1999 (RegCM2.5), 2006 (RegCM3) and most recently 2010 (RegCM4).
 The latest version of the model, RegCM4, is now fully supported by the ESP,
 while previous versions are no longer available. This version includes major
 upgrades in the structure of the code and its pre- and post- processors,
 along with the inclusion of some new physics parameterizations.
 The model is flexible, portable and easy to use. It can be applied to any
 region of the World, with grid spacing of up to about 3 km,  and for a wide
 range of studies, from process studies to paleoclimate and future climate
 simulation.

 ESP also supports the Regional Climate Research Network, or RegCNET. The
 objective of RegCNET is to expand and strengthen the network of model users
 and to develop collaborative research projects across the network to improve
 the understanding of climate change at the regional scale.
 The RegCNET also provides a forum for current and future model users to
 discuss relevant issues, exchange research experiences and formulate needs
 and priorities for further model development and dissemination.
